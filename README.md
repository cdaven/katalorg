- [Andy Matuschak's note-link-janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor/) does about the same thing, but probably not exactly the same. I haven't tried it.
- [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) gives you backlinks and a graph inside Visual Studio Code.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has this stuff built into the application itself. (But make sure you read the license if you don't want to pay for it.)
